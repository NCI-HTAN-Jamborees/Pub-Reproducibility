# Pub-Reproducibility
NCI Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) Data Jamboree | Dec. 4-7, 2023


## Introduction 
Data reproducibility is a fundamental principle in science and allows for scientific validation, progress, and for the scientific community to build on each other's findings. Transparency of data and methods is applicable in all scientific fields, including single cell. [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d42473-019-00004-y)

## Goals
We are focusing on assessing single cell data reproducibilty defined by:
- regenerating computational figures
- reproducing cell type annotation from re-clustering and analysis
- looking at DGE analysis and seeing how this compares to published results
- obtaining and reusing experimental metadata for figure generation
