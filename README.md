# Publication Reproducibility
Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) Data Jamboree | Dec. 4-7, 2023

## Introduction 
Data reproducibility is a fundamental foundation of science and allows for scientific research to validate and progress.  (https://www.nature.com/articles/d42473-019-00004-y)

## Goals
We are focusing on assessing single cell data reproducibilty defined by:
- regenerating computational analysis figures found in the publication
- reproducing cell type annotation from re-clustering and analysis
- looking at DGE analysis and seeing how this compares to published results
- obtaining and reusing experimental metadata for 

## Data
The dataset we chose is the small cell lung cancer (SCLC) found at [HTAN MSK] (https://humantumoratlas.org/explore?selectedFilters=%5B%7B%22group%22%3A%22AtlasName%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22HTAN+MSK%22%7D%5D)

## Code
- We organized the code in the repo based off of the figure number in the original paper
